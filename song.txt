Shoot me down and I'll get up again
Emotions running high with double meaning
Just another day to keep it calm within
But I can't find a way to fight this shadow dreaming

We're always waiting for the night
Never lost
We can go where the light shines brightest
We're always waiting for the night
So come with me
And we can go where the light shines brightest
