Shoot me down and I'll get up again
Emotions running high with double meaning
Just another day to keep it calm within
But I can't find a way to fight this shadow dreaming

We're always waiting for the night
Never lost
We can go where the light shines brightest
We're always waiting for the night
So come with me
And we can go where the light shines brightest

Stay all night, run away all night
We'll stay all night, run away all night
Stay all night, run away all night
We'll stay all night, run away all night

Push and shove against the thoughts you left me with
Every picture of regret my expectation
Your emotions can't hide behind those eyes
Conversations comes quick to steal me back again
